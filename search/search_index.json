It just feels so good to start, progress, and finish a task. What makes productivity satisfying to me is that when I work, I believe that I am making progress towards the completion of my calling. </p> <p>My love for productivity came from an understanding of myself. God has revealed my identity and my purpose, which He also continues to develop. </p> <p>I love games and constantly have to put down the controller. God showed me why I love games. I play a lot of character development games like RPGs and looting games. I like progression, building stats, and obtaining items to make my character or teams strong. God showed me that I\u2019m meant to do that in the real world with myself and others. So, in effect, I love personal development, teaching, and Project Management(Just to name a few...). I love to see people and things grow from one stage to another. So, my constant focus is seeking how I can grow myself and others up for the building of God\u2019s Kingdom.</p> <p>How to apply the Word of God(The Bible) into your everyday life. How to live a truly fulfilled life. Adding small bits of fulfillment/satisfaction.</p> <p>The role of a disciple encompasses all areas of a person\u2019s life.

Would you like tips for becoming a more productive and peace-filled individual?</p> <p> Then this site is for YOU.</p> <p> I write to learners, strategists, and thinkers like myself.</p> <p></p> <p>I am constantly asking the question of \u201cHow can I live a more fruitful life as a Disciple of Christ?\u201d </p> <p></p> To me, living means: <ul> <li>Being spiritually healthy by developing and maintaining a relationship with God.</li> <li>Being physically fit and healthy.</li> <li>Being mentally aware and honest with myself.</li> <li>Having healthy relationships with my family as a Husband &amp; Dad.</li><li>Being hard working and productive in the things I do.</li> <li>Learning my Identity and walking in it.</li> <li>Being productive in all areas of my life.</li> </ul> <p>  Furthermore, I believe being fruitful is to have Biblical values represented in my life. </p> <p></p> <p>I am a constant student and note taker. I seek new information daily through research, reading books, watching videos, conversations, etc.</p> <p> I'm also a devoted note taker. I'm ready to take notes on literally anything that I experience or come across. I'm an avid believer in that information flows in streams all the time and all around us. If the drifting golden nuggets of life aren't captured, then they may be lost forever. </p> <p> It is my mission, duty, and pleasure to record as much as I can.</p> <p></p> Some Topics I Write About:  <ul> <li>Having a relationship with God</li> <li>Highlighting scriptural principles that can be easily applied to daily life</li> <li>Lessons learned and reflections about the Bible</li> <li>Self Improvement &amp; Productivity</li> <li>Tips, Tricks, &amp; Hacks to Improve Life</li> <li>Technology</li> <li>Journaling prompts</li> <li>Fiction &amp; Non-Fiction</li> </ul> <p> All the concepts I write about aren\u2019t mine originally. I'm a firm believer in that all knowledge belongs to and comes from God. From before the foundation of the Earth, He created it all. So, in essence I consider myself an eternal student in God's classroom. A pioneer exploring the uncharted lands of a new world. </p> <p> As I live and learn, I'll share my notes and personal insights.  </p> <p> God bless!</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/Hide%20Footer/","title":"Hide Footer","text":"<p>hide:   - footer</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/Hide%20Navigation%20-%20Left%20Right/","title":"Hide Navigation   Left Right","text":"<p>hide:   - navigation   - toc</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/Link%20with%20Instant%20Preview/","title":"Link with Instant Preview","text":"<p>LINK</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/New%20Blog%20Post/","title":"New Blog Post","text":"<p>.--- date: readtime:  draft: true  description:  categories:   - changeme authors:  - JovanGash</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/br/","title":"Br","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h1/","title":"H1","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h2/","title":"H2","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h3/","title":"H3","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h4/","title":"H4","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h5/","title":"H5","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/h6/","title":"H6","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/img/","title":"Img","text":"<p>.</p>"},{"location":"1-Templates/li/","title":"Li","text":""},{"location":"1-Templates/ul/","title":"Ul","text":""},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog Home","text":"<p>Hey, I'm new! </p> <p>Stay tuned for fresh blog posts!</p>"}]}
